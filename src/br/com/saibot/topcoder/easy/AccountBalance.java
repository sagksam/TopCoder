/**
 * You are working for the financial institution TopBank, and you have been tasked with writing a module that will take an initial account balance, along with a list of that day's transactions, and return the ending balance for the day.
 * Each transaction will be either a credit, which adds funds to the account, or a debit, which removes funds from the account. 
 * If a debit exceeds the available funds at the time, then the account balance will go negative. 
 * You will be given an startingBalance, the initial account balance. You will also be given a transactions, the list of transactions for the day. Each element of transactions will be in the form "type amount" (quotes added for clarity). 
 * Each type will be 'C' or 'D', for credit or debit, respectively. Each amount will be an integer between 1 and 1000000, inclusive, with no leading zeros. You are to return an representing the ending balance after processing all of the transactions
 * STATUS: DONE!!
